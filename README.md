## Formatting

To install `pre-commit` hooks locally, execute `pip install pre-commit`
followed by `pre-commit install`. This only needs to be done once per repo,
and from then on checks are made whenever committing. See steps
[here](https://pre-commit.com/#automatically-enabling-pre-commit-on-repositories)
to enable these checks always.
